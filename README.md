# Fish Tank

A C#.Net Core class library to help someone manage their fish tank!

## Tools, Technologies and Concepts Used
- .Net Core 3.0
- .Net Core CLI
- NUnit
- Dependency injection
- Encapsulation
- Loose coupling via interface use

## In a future iteration, I would like to...
- Learn how to use parameterised unit tests to re-use certain tests
- Explore the possibility of creating a Fish base class that can be the parent of GoldFish and the others, to make the code inside the fish classes more DRY
